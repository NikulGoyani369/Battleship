Game Battleship 


Battleship (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players. It is played on
ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player marks a fleet of ships (including
battleships). The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players
alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships. The objective of the game is to
destroy the opposing player's fleet.
